<h3> About me</h3>
I**** am a Graduate Student at University of Colorado Boulder. Electrical and Computer Engineering is my major. I like developing software and I have a keen interest towards DevOps Engineering. <br>
<h5>My skills :</h5>
- Languages - Python, Java, Ruby, Bash Scripting <br>
- Technology - Amazon AWS, Ansible, Vagrant, Docker, Git,  MySql <br>
- Web Tools - Flask, Django, HTML, Nodejs <br>

Along with these, a good knowledge of Linux Systems. <br>

One could also have a look at my Resume [here] .


<h3> Where did I start? </h3>
I started off as an undergraduate student in Mechatronics Engineering, back in India. It was one of those times when I got my hands dirty building and exploring all sorts of stuff that would interest me. Yet, I was  not really heading in any specific direction. Over my 4 years of undergraduate study, I did not really develop a finesse or an interest for software or web development.

<h3> When I started Software Development ... </h3>

When I transitioned towards a Master's degree at CU Boulder, I took classes in Web and Embedded security in the first semester. Those were my initial steps towards software development. I begin creating Web application centered around Mobile IoT, using PHP and MYSql. For someone from a "Mechanical Engineering" background, this was already overwhelming! Throughout the semester I enjoyed creating cool things with Embedded development boards and Web UI.

<h3> Later and now ...</h3>

I continued taking classes related to Object Oriented Programming and Network Systems. I developed a solid interest towards Back-End and Systems engineering. I developed a unique interest towards DevOps Engineering and I am currently working towards my rather stream-lined interest.  <br>
<br>


<h3> What are some of the coolest things that I have done ? </h3>


 I wrote a Client-Side Load balancing Library in Java - not liking the way in which load balancing in current Microservices Architecture are handled. Later my curiosity brought me a step further and I evaluated the performance of the Load Balancer Client against a conventional Load balancer like the Nginx.

 I am also working on a Website Uptime monitoring Library that uses Redis at the Back-End for persistent storage and the application is written in Python. I am integrating email and text-alert functionality for this tool that I have named "Pysite Watch".

 More cool stuff - with a minor background in Embedded Systems, I like bare-metal servers running on Embedded development boards such as a BeagleBone Black or a Raspberry Pi. I like hacking these things to get something best out of them. One of the coolest setup that I have, is a cluster of BeagleBones that I have setup as  my personal-server! I have run automation tools such as Ansible on them and have made great use out of them. These feel really wonderful - it is also my preference that I use something real as compared to  quotidian Virtual Machines. After all, what is the fun in using just VMs? <br>

<h3> What would I like continue doing ? </h3>
I would like to continue programming, developing applications and hacking together stuff. On the other hand, I want to be really strong with Linux Systems (being a good systems guy is one of my top priorities) and would want to be good with tools like Ansible, Vagrant, Docker, Kubernetes, Redis and Cloud Infrastructure like AWS. I want to work with, automate and develop applications at a scale. With my minor background in Embedded Systems, I would occasionally work and play with cool weekend projects relating to  Mobile IoT, making them exciting and powerful with a touch of software.
<br>


For a beginning, I am giving my best to work on open source softwares and I am really excited to contribute something to the open-source community! I am  looking forward to sharing my experiences as a Software Developer here on my blog.<br>
