I am a Graduate Student at University of Colorado Boulder. Electrical and Computer Engineering is my major. My interests lie in general Software and Systems programming.<br>
<br>

I like developing applications in general, and I am most intrigued about large and scalable software systems. With a minor background in Embedded Systems, I like bare-metal servers running on Embedded development boards such as a BeagleBone Black or a Raspberry Pi. I like hacking these things to get something best out of them. In fact, I have a cluster of BeagleBones that I have setup as a my personal-server! I have run automation tools such as Ansible on them and have made great use out of them. These feel really wonderful - it is also my preference that I use something real as compared to  quotidian Virtual Machines. After all, what is the fun in using just VMs?<br>
<br>

Apart from Linux Systems, I also develop web-applications. I have some extensive experience working with Python and PHP developing applications. I have used Flask and Django in the past and have also deployed a couple of applications onto Amazon AWS. Now a new found interest in Systems and Network programming. I am trying my best to work on open source softwares and I am really excited to contribute something to the open-source community!<br>
