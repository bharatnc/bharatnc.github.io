### Writing a Dockerfile.

### Basic Components:
**FROM** keyword - This is used to specify the image that has to be used while building a Dockerfile.
**ADD** keyword. This is used to add a directory on the host machine to a relative location on the container. Takes two parameters source and destination directories
**WORKDIR** keyword. This is used to specify the working directory in a container.
**RUN** keyword. This is used to specify the commands that have to be run when bringing up a container. In other words, installation that is required can be done using this command.
**CMD** keyword. This contains a list of arguments that can be used to execute a service or a program.
 
### Sample Dockerfile:

{% highlight ruby %}

FROM python
ADD . /code
WORKDIR /code
RUN  pip install requirements.txt
CMD [“ls”]
 
requirements.txt file
--------------------------
redis
flask

{% endhighlight %}

### Writing a docker-compose file:
 
 
### Basic components:
**version** - version of the dockerfile. More information about the ‘version’ can be found on the version link
**services** - defines the services that are going to be defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
### keywords within these services:
**build** : Specifies the build directory for the docker container. Use “.” for referencing the current build directory
**ports:** Can be used to bind the containers’ port and the port on the host machine volumes
**volumes**: Directories can be mounted as volumes and this keyword is used to specify        the folder that has to be mounted.
**image** - This keyword is mainly used for specifying the type of image that has to be used for a particular service.
 
### Sample docker-compose.yml file.
 
In this example I’m using a simple example of a redis db that is being run as a web service and from within flask web application. This is the same example that they have used in Docker’s official documentation.

{% highlight ruby %}
version: ‘3’
services: web
 web:
  build:
  ports:
  volumes:
 redis:
  image: “redis”
  
 {% endhighlight %}

In the above example, the reference to the version 3 of Dockerfile is used and the the services that are run are the redis and web services. The web is a flask application that reads and writes query from a redis server that is as a container.
